'Rules: 
'------
'1. Use "SELECT" only!
'2. Start line with a "'" as first (!) char to declare as comment
'3. Always use {{{ObjectIdQueryName}}} as first argument in a query (will be replaced with the CMIS OBJECT_ID definition)
'4. Always add "::Type=" after the query and give the CMIS-resolvable type name to query for
'5. Use {{{TypeQueryName}}} in the "FROM" clause - which will be replaced by the CMIS resolved type
'' 
' Note 1: CMIS benchmark will random select one of the queries in each execution
' Note 2: the code is currently NOT not save for SQL Injection - be sure for what you do .... 
'
SELECT {{{ObjectIdQueryName}}} FROM {{{TypeQueryName}}}::Type=cmis:folder
